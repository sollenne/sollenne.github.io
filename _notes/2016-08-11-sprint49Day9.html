        <p>@sollenne: please triage these bugs in this order:</p>
        <pre>
        MGS-1710
        MGS-1638
        MGS-1670</pre>
        <p>by triage, I mean, run through the scenarios in each bug and determine if its still an issue, if it is, understand if its our issue or someone elseâ€™s, if its ours, is it really a bug or is it an enhancement, after each one, lets get together to determine the next course of action, cool?</p>

            <p>Fixed issue, we were setting <code>height: 810px</code> on the iFrame in Staging. This was causing the inability to scroll the iframe.</p>
