<p>I've needed to get my blog underway for a long time now. There are so many times when I'm blocked and scouring 
    the depths of Stack Overflow for answers when I see other developers seeking the same answers that I do, but 
    nobody seems to offer any sort of satisfactory conclusion to the problem. And if you're like me, <!--excerpt_separator-->I not only like 
    to know the answer, but I need to know what caused the issue in the first place and how that fits into my 
    workflow. So, here I am, blogging away to move our industry forward in the best way I know how.  
</p>

<p>A far as this site goes, It's obviously combined with my portfolio and personal sales-pitch. I am, after all, a 
    developer that needs to put grub on my family's table. Aside from that, Now that it's at a usable state, I'm 
    going to share how I finish it out. There are some good things coming;
    
    <ul class="strong">
        <li>Styling the 'Disqus' commenting system (if possible).</li>
        <li>Implementing site/blog search</li>
        <li>Some Twitter integration</li>
        <li>Adding projects</li>
        <li>Github integration</li>
        <li>Adding resume/Print version of resume</li>
        <li>More fluid jekyll workflow</li>
        <li>My workflow and recommendations</li>
        <li>Probably more...</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>For now, The next thing I'm working on, is getting some static content filled out, like the sections on the home 
    page (services/portfolio/contact), and styling the blog portion of the home page. This site is hosted on github 
    using jekyll, which replaced the sandbox that I WAS using for personal projects etc. I really need to break those
    out into their own github repositories using github pages. I rely on these for my code examples when recruiters 
    come knocking, and to provide examples to things I've done. That may be the next big undertaking.
