        I tested this one for several hours in multiple situations and was never able to reproduce.    
            
        The way I'm testing today is changing the timeout values in `mgoConfig.json`.    
        This didn't work the first time. I'm rebuilding to see if that works.
        Closed officially. It looks like the test modal was put there for test resolution but it's a non blocker.
